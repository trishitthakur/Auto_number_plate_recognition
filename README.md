# Auto_number_plate_recognition
Web App which Recognizes License number plates and OCR for character and digit extraction


*The motive behind developing the AUTOMATIC NUMBER PLATE RECOGNITION project stemmed from the need to enhance 
traffic monitoring and enforcement systems, with a specific focus on accurate license plate recognition. 
As I delved into the world of transportation and traffic management, I became aware of the challenges faced by 
law enforcement agencies and urban planners in effectively monitoring and managing vehicular movement.


*One crucial aspect that caught my attention was the manual effort and time required for license plate identification 
in various scenarios, such as toll booths, parking lots, and traffic violations. Manual recognition was not only 
labor-intensive but also prone to errors, resulting in inefficient monitoring and enforcement. I was determined to find 
a solution that would automate this process and improve accuracy.


*To solidify my motivation, I came across relevant data statistics indicating the need for an automated license plate 
recognition system. For instance, a study conducted by a transportation research institute found that an average of 1 in 10
vehicles violated traffic regulations, with many cases going undetected due to limited resources and manual monitoring constraints.
These violations had a significant impact on road safety, traffic flow, and the overall well-being of communities.


*Motivated by these challenges, I embarked on developing the AUTOMATIC NUMBER PLATE RECOGNITION project. My goal was to create an
efficient and accurate system that could automatically recognize license number plates using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 
techniques for character and digit extraction.


*To accomplish this, I harnessed the power of Python, OpenCV/pillow, Google Cloud OCR, Tensorflow, and Flask. I leveraged image 
processing and computer vision algorithms to preprocess the license plate images and extract the characters and digits for recognition.
By utilizing machine learning models built with Tensorflow, I trained the system to accurately classify and identify the characters on the license plates.


*The integration of Google Cloud OCR provided an additional layer of accuracy and flexibility, enabling the system to handle various fonts, 
languages, and license plate formats. The Flask framework allowed for seamless web application development, creating an intuitive interface 
for users to interact with the system.


*Throughout the development process, I focused on increasing the accuracy of the AI model. By conducting extensive training and fine-tuning,
I achieved remarkable results, significantly reducing false positives and negatives. The higher accuracy of the system was crucial for reliable
 traffic monitoring, toll collection, and enforcing traffic regulations.
